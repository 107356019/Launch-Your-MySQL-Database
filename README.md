# Launch Your MySQL Database
## ECV Bootcamp

This lab builds on the previous lab. It walks you through launching an Amazon Relation Database Service (RDS) DB instance. You will configure the LAMP server that you previously created to use Amazon RDS for its relational database management system needs. This lab is designed to connect DB instance through a web service phpMyAdmin.
